go-chart

This project is archived!

I originally released this as a way to publish stock charts in slack bots. It was kind of fun at the time! I never anticipated that it would become heavily used, and as often happens with open source, I have a ton of time commitments elsewhere, and can't reasonbly devote enough time to this project to match the usage.

There have been a number of forks over time, I'd encourage you all to seek those out, or new charting libraries. 

Best,
